The schema inference tool generates a HyDRa file containing the polystore physical schema.

In order to preliminary evualate our approach, it is possible to compare the results with the input datasets documentation containing the schemas definitions.

The 'Northwind' MariaDB database schema is available as a SVG file at [Northwind](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/assets/img/datasets-generated/northwind.svg).

The 'Metricity' MongoDB database schema is available as a JSON file in the [application](../datasets/metricity/schema.json) folder.

The 'movie' and 'beers' Redis databases schemas are available on the following GitHub repositories:
- [Movies](https://github.com/Redis-Developer/redis-datasets/tree/movie-dataset/movie-database)
- [Beers](https://github.com/Redis-Developer/redis-datasets/tree/master/redisearch/openbeerdb)
